Tetris on a Freescale M68HC12 microprocessor
============================================


- Playstation 1 controller hooked up to the SPI bus at 62.5 kHz
- 256x128 LCD display hooked up to Ports G (data) and H (control lines)

If anyone is interested, we can get the exact model for the LCD to make sure it works. It was about $20.
